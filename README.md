# Setup

## Basic info

You can go to my youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC847dupXQ7ImxcN0PfTRJKw) and watch my discord.js series to find out more information.
This is the basic command and event handler.
You can replace the info in `config.json` with your own prefix and token.
If you don't know where to get your token, or if you don't know what a token is in the first place, check the section below.

## Making the application

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and sign in if you haven't already. Click `New Application`, and give it a name. Then click `add`.
2. Now, go to the **bot** tab on the left, and click `Add Bot`. Click `Yes, do it`, and then you've added your bot to your application!
3. Next, go to the **oAuth2** tab on the left, and scroll down. Select the _bot_ scope, and then click the _administrator_ permission. All the other permissions should gray out.
