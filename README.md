# Setup

## Basic info

- You can go to my youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC847dupXQ7ImxcN0PfTRJKw) and watch my discord.js series to find out more information.
- This is the basic command and event handler.
- You can replace the info in `config.json` with your own prefix and token.
- If you don't know where to get your token, or if you don't know what a token is in the first place, check the section below.

## Making the application

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and sign in if you haven't already. Click `New Application`, and give it a name. Then click `add`.
2. Now, go to the **bot** tab on the left, and click `Add Bot`. Click `Yes, do it`, and then you've added your bot to your application!
3. Next, go to the **oAuth2** tab on the left, and scroll down. Select the _bot_ scope, and then click the _administrator_ permission. All the other permissions should gray out.
4. Now, copy the URL and paste it in your browser. Invited the bot to your server like you would any other bot.
  - Your bot should be in your server!
5. Now go back to the **bot** tab on the left and copying the token. The token is basically your access code to your bot. Keep it safe and very secure, as if anyone gets it, they can hack your bot.
6. Go back to the code IDE you use, and in the config.json file, replace the `your token here` with your token. Then replace the `your prefix here` with your prefix, if you haven't already.
- A _prefix_ is the character(s) that come before each command you run. One example of a prefix is **!**.

#### Now you're ready to start coding your commands!
